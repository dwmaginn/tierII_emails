## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Microsoft 365 business account
- Azure AD application with SMTP permissions

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cannabis-email-campaign.git
   cd cannabis-email-campaign
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure OAuth 2.0**
   
   Run the setup guide to configure Microsoft 365 OAuth:
   ```bash
   python oauth_setup_guide.py
   ```
   
   Follow the detailed instructions to:
   - Enable SMTP AUTH in Microsoft 365
   - Register an Azure AD application
   - Configure API permissions
   - Generate client credentials

4. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Copy the example environment file and configure your credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` with your actual credentials:
   ```bash
   # Required OAuth credentials
   TIERII_SENDER_EMAIL=your-email@domain.com
   TIERII_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.office365.com
   TIERII_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
   TIERII_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   TIERII_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   TIERII_EMAIL_SUBJECT="Your Email Subject"
   ```
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY WARNING**: Never commit `.env` files to version control!

5. **Test your setup**
   ```bash
   python test_email_settings.py
   ```

### Running the Campaign

1. **Verify your contact data**
   ```bash
   python test_csv_reader.py
   ```

2. **Launch the email campaign**
   ```bash
   python email_campaign.py
   ```

The script will:
- Load contacts from the CSV file
- Show a preview of contacts
- Send a test email for verification
- Wait for your approval before sending to all contacts
- Process emails in batches with configurable delays

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Email Settings (`config.py`)

- `SENDER_EMAIL`: Your Microsoft 365 email address
- `SMTP_SERVER`: Microsoft 365 SMTP server (smtp.office365.com)
- `SMTP_PORT`: SMTP port (587 for TLS)
- `BATCH_SIZE`: Number of emails per batch (default: 10)
- `DELAY_MINUTES`: Minutes to wait between batches (default: 3)

### OAuth Credentials

- `TENANT_ID`: Your Azure AD tenant ID
- `CLIENT_ID`: Your Azure AD application client ID
- `CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Azure AD application client secret

## üìä Data Source

The project includes a verified CSV database (`tier_i_tier_ii_emails_verified.csv`) containing:

- **120 verified contacts** from licensed NY cannabis businesses
- **License information**: License numbers, types, and status
- **Business details**: Entity names, addresses, and operational status
- **Contact information**: Primary contact names and email addresses
- **Business categories**: Tier types and processor classifications

## üîí Security & Compliance

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY WARNINGS

**Environment Variables & Secrets Management:**
- **NEVER commit `.env` files to version control** - they contain sensitive credentials
- **NEVER hardcode secrets** in source code or configuration files
- **Use unique, strong client secrets** and rotate them regularly
- **Limit access** to `.env` files using appropriate file permissions (600/640)
- **Use Azure Key Vault** or similar secret management for production deployments
- **Audit access** to configuration files and credentials regularly

**OAuth 2.0 Security:**
- **Verify redirect URIs** are properly configured in Azure AD
- **Use least privilege** - only grant necessary API permissions
- **Monitor token usage** and revoke compromised tokens immediately
- **Enable MFA** on accounts with OAuth application access

**Development Security:**
- **Use separate credentials** for development, staging, and production
- **Never share credentials** via email, chat, or other insecure channels
- **Clean up test data** and temporary credentials after development
- **Review code changes** for accidentally committed secrets before merging

### Data Protection
- OAuth 2.0 authentication (no password storage)
- Automatic token refresh and management
- Environment-based secure credential handling
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization

### Email Compliance
- Personalized, relevant business communications
- Clear sender identification
- Professional email content
- Respect for recipient preferences

### Legal Considerations
- Targets only licensed cannabis businesses
- Business-to-business communications
- Compliant with cannabis industry regulations
- Follows email marketing best practices
