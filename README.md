## üîí Security & Compliance

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY WARNINGS

**Environment Variables & Secrets Management:**
- **NEVER commit `.env` files to version control** - they contain sensitive credentials
- **NEVER hardcode secrets** in source code or configuration files
- **Use unique, strong API tokens** and rotate them regularly
- **Limit access** to `.env` files using appropriate file permissions (600/640)
- **Use secure secret management** for production deployments
- **Audit access** to configuration files and credentials regularly

**MailerSend API Security:**
- **Protect your API token** - treat it like a password
- **Use domain verification** to prevent unauthorized sending
- **Monitor API usage** and revoke compromised tokens immediately
- **Enable webhook security** for delivery tracking

**Development Security:**
- **Use separate credentials** for development, staging, and production
- **Never share credentials** via email, chat, or other insecure channels
- **Clean up test data** and temporary credentials after development
- **Review code changes** for accidentally committed secrets before merging

### Data Protection
- MailerSend API authentication (secure token-based access)
- Environment-based secure credential handling
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization

### Email Compliance
- Personalized, relevant business communications
- Clear sender identification
- Professional email content
- Respect for recipient preferences

### Legal Considerations

- Business-to-business communications
- Compliant with cannabis industry regulations
- Follows email marketing best practices
